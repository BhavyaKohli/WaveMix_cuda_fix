To allow image analysis in resource-constrained scenarios without compromising generalizability, we introduce WaveMix -- a novel and flexible neural framework that reduces the GPU RAM (memory) and compute (latency) compared to CNNs and transformers. In addition to using convolutional layers that exploit shift-invariant image statistics, the proposed framework uses multi-level two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2D-DWT) modules to exploit scale-invariance and edge sparseness, which gives it the following advantages. Firstly, the fixed weights of wavelet modules do not add to the parameter count while reorganizing information based on these image priors. Secondly, the wavelet modules scale the spatial extents of feature maps by integral powers of 1/2Ã—1/2, which reduces the memory and latency required for forward and backward passes. Finally, a multi-level 2D-DWT leads to a quicker expansion of the receptive field per layer than pooling (which we do not use) and it is a more effective spatial token mixer. WaveMix also generalizes better than other token mixing models, such as ConvMixer, MLP-Mixer, PoolFormer, random filters, and Fourier basis, because the wavelet transform is much better suited for image decomposition and spatial token mixing. WaveMix is a flexible model that can perform well on multiple image tasks without needing architectural modifications. WaveMix achieves a semantic segmentation mIoU of 83% on the Cityscapes validation set outperforming transformer and CNN-based architectures. We also demonstrate the advantages of WaveMix for classification on multiple datasets and show that WaveMix establishes new state-of-the-results in Places-365, EMNIST, and iNAT-mini datasets.

The high parameter efficiency is obtained by replacing Deconvolution layers with Upsampling
